            <h4>Mega Blood Donation Campüë®‚Äçüíª</h4>
            We are glad to share that the NSS club is conducting the MEGA BLOOD DONATION CAMP on the ocassion of NSS day. 
            <h6>A donation of blood means a few minutes to you, but a lifetime for somebody else.</h6>
            <br>We encourage you wholeheartedly to join in the camp and coopearte with us to complete our goal.<br>
            A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
            <br>The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood.Neither of your blood will get waste and will remain protected.

            <h4>Tree Plantation üå±</h4>
            We are glad to share that the NSS club is conducting Tree Planatation event inside and outside the university.
            <br>Van Mahotsav or Vanamahotsava, lit.‚Äâ'Forest festival', is an annual one-week tree-planting festival in India which is celebrated in the first week of July.By encouraging Indians to support tree planting and tending, festival organizers hope to create more forests in the country. It would provide alternative fuels, increase production of food resources, create shelter-belts around fields to increase productivity, provide food and shade for cattle, offer shade and decorative landscapes, reduce drought, and help to prevent soil erosion. The first week of July is just the right time for planting trees in most parts of India since it coincides with the monsoon.
             <br>Trees and forests play a very crucial role in maintaining an ecological balance and providing oxygen to human beings on the planet. The Van Mahotsav week is a reminder that we must protect forests and stop deforestation and practice the 3R rule- Reduce, reuse and recycle.
